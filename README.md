Network Consensus Protocol

“Ecova & Ethem are the native tokens of a Ecova Blockchain Platform with Ecova being a primary asset token following inflationary model and Ethem being a network resource token following deflationary model.”

Ecova aims to provide a scalable effective consensus model which in turn guaranties higher decentralized network by combining the best practice of both coordinated and competitive approaches in creating a Hybrid Governance model to achieve higher success rate in terms of performance and security. 

Well in a Ecova the entire network in whole is partitioned into a two segments of ordinates trying to coordinate in processing entirely two different blocks asynchronously at the same time but with one ordinate said not publish the processed ledger without it including the other ordinate’s processed ledger and vice versa.

Due to its simple hypothetical design philosophy of odd and even sequence of a chain format ledger in a global asynchronous commitment ledger, it simply follows a analogy of copycats.
